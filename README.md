* Location Filter:
   > a) Includes a text input field or dropdown menu that filters the map markers and list items to locations matching the text input or selection. Filter function runs error-free.

 * List View:
    > a) A list-view of location names is provided which displays all locations by default, and displays the filtered subset of locations when a filter is applied.
    > b) Clicking a location on the list displays unique information about the location, and animates its associated map marker (e.g. bouncing, color change.)
    > c) List functionality is responsive and runs error free.

* Map and Markers:
    > a) Map displays all location markers by default, and displays the filtered subset of location markers when a filter is applied.

    > b) Clicking a marker displays unique information about a location somewhere on the page (modal, separate div, inside an infoWindow).
    > c) Any additional custom functionality provided in the app functions error-free.

* Location Details:
    > a) Additional Location Data:
    > 1) Functionality providing additional data about a location is provided and sourced from a          3rd party API. Information can be provided either in the markerâ€™s infoWindow, or in an            HTML element in the DOM (a sidebar, the list view, a modal, etc.)

### 4. _Usage_
